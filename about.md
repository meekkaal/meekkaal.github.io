I have a passion for learning new things and applying them, especially when it comes to technology and finding ways to positively impact the world. This site will be a place where I can showcase projects I'm working on along with other things that interest me.

Outside of technology, I enjoy making music and serve as one of the guitarists in [EVERYN](https://everyn.bandcamp.com). 

I have a dog named Riff and a cat named Luna.
